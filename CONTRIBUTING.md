1. Do not submit only one line changes if not neccessary. Instead you could write a comment for example.
2. If you submit code, you have to be the author of this code or hold the right to publish it under a mit license without naming the real author.
3. The submitted code should be tested and should work when submitting.
4. If you don't follow this rules, all your future submits could be ignored and dismissed.

When you are not sure if your submit would follow this guidelines, just submit. Everyone has such situations and when you don't do anything, it would not help anyone.
